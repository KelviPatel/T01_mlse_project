In a lush forest, there lived a tortoise. One day the tortoise was resting under a tree where he noticed that a bird’s nest. He wondered, “how can someone live here?” Around the same time the bird flew into the nest. The tortoise spoke to the bird mockingly, “What a shabby home you have! It is made of broken twigs, it has no roof and it looks crude. And the worst part is that you had to build yourself. I think my house, which is my shell is much better than your nest.”

The bird replied, I know it is crude, made of broken sticks, look shabby, but it is open to the nature. I built it with hard work and I like it.

The tortoise replied proudly, “I guess it’s like any other nest, but not better than mine. You must be jealous of my shell, though.”

“On the contrary, my home has space for family and friends; your shell cannot accommodate anyone other than you. Maybe you have a better house, but I have a better home,” said the bird happily.
