The Lion and the Mouse:
One sunny afternoon, a big, strong lion lay sleeping in the jungle. Along came a tiny mouse, scampering over sticks and leaves, and by accident, he ran across the lion’s paw. The lion awoke with a loud roar and quickly caught the little mouse beneath his big paw.

“Please, mighty Lion, spare me!” squeaked the mouse. “If you let me go, I promise to repay your kindness one day!”

The lion laughed, thinking, “How could this tiny creature ever help me?” But he was feeling generous, so he lifted his paw and let the mouse go free.

A few days later, the lion was prowling the jungle when he was trapped in a hunter’s net. He struggled and roared, but the ropes held tight. The mouse heard his roars and rushed to his aid. “Don’t worry, dear Lion! I’ll help you!” The mouse began gnawing through the ropes with his sharp little teeth, and before long, the lion was free!

The lion looked down at his tiny friend in amazement and gratitude. “Thank you, little mouse. I see now that even the smallest friend can make a big difference.”

And from that day on, the lion and the mouse were friends for life, proving to everyone that kindness is always returned in unexpected ways.
