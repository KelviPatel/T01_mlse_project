Two Silly Goats
In a beautiful village, there was a large river that cut two big mountains. The village people had built a very small narrow bridge across the river to cross it. The bridge was so narrow that only one person could cross it at a time.

One day, two goats started approaching each other from the two different ends of the bridge. Since the bridge could only be used by one person at a time, both the goats could not have cross debt at the same time. They walked halfway on the bridge till they were face-to-face, waiting for the other one to turn back and let the other one cross. But neither of them was willing to do so.

“Move aside!” said the one goat to the other.

“No you move aside. Let me cross first.”

Both the goats soon started arguing, and the argument quickly turned into a fight.

The goats locked horns, and started fighting, fiercely. While fighting, they forgot about the bridge and no time, they lost their balance and fell into the river.

Some days later, a similar incident occurred with two other goats. However, this time the goats were wise, one of the goats laid down on the bridge while allowing the other to pass through the bridge. As soon as she passed the other goat stood up and crossed the river safely.
