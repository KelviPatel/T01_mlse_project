9. The Fox and the Stork
In a big green jungle, there used to live a fox and a stork, they were both neighbours. The fox was very cunning and selfish. One day he invited his neighbour, the stork, to dinner at his house. The stork was surprised by the invitation, but happily accepted. That evening, the stork went to the fox’s home and knocked on the door with his long beak. The fox opened the door and invited the stork inside. The stark could smell the delicious soup that the fox had prepared.

The stork was very hungry. The fox kept the stork waiting for a long time so that the stork is hungry even more. Afterwards he served soup for dinner slyly in shallow bowls. Since it was a shallow bowl, it was easy for the fox to eat it all, but poor stork could not have any of it. The dish was too shallow for his long beak to drink the soup. The poor stork smiled politely and left hungry.
