Once upon a time, there was a farmer who possess the most wonderful goose you can ever imagine. Every day when the farmer visited the nest, the goose had laid a beautiful glittering golden egg. The farmer took the eggs to the market and soon begin to get rich.

The farmer was getting richer and richer every day he began to become impatient. He was upset at the goose because she was yielding him only one golden egg per day. He was not getting rich fast enough. Then, one day, after he had finished counting his money, he got an idea. He thought, “What if I kill the goose and get all the golden eggs all at once?

The next day, when he went to fetch the golden egg, he killed the goose. But he could not find any more golden eggs and precious goose was dead too.
