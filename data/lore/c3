One summer day, a fox was walking through a field when he saw a bunch of juicy grapes dangling high above his head. “I wish I could have some of those to quench my thirst,” he said to himself. But the grapes were out of reach. The fox stood on his back legs and stretched his neck as far as he could, but the grapes were still too high up, he took several steps backward, ran towards the grapevine, and took a giant leap, but he missed them. So the fox tried again from the other direction. He ran as fast as he could, and sprang into the air, but he missed them once more. Determined to get the delicious grapes, the fox jumped again and again.

Now he was even hotter and thirsty than before, and he still hadn’t managed to reach a single grape. Finally, the fox looked at the grapes with disgust. “I don’t know why I am wasting my time, trying to get those horrible grapes,” he said. “I’m sure they taste really sour!”
