Determined to teach the fox a lesson, the stork invited the fox for dinner the following week. When the fox arrived at the stork’s house, he smelled something delicious cooking. The fox thought the stork is not as sly and cunning as he is. He thought the stork will not fool him. As he was thinking about the food the stork walked in with two large tall jars filled with stew. The fox was tempted, but as soon as he tried to taste the stew, his mouth got stuck in the neck of the bottle jar. The stork easily drank the stew by putting his large beak inside the jar and the fox could only lick the rim of the pot and sniff the food. Much as he didn’t want to, the fox had to admit, that he had been outsmarted and he had to go home with an empty stomach.
