11. The Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing
Once upon a time, there lived a clever wolf near a farm. The wolf wanted to eat the sheep on the farm. He used to watch them from some distance every day. He noticed that the sheep would follow anyone, and when they were alone, they just followed each other.

“Foolish sheep!” he thought and went to the farm to get the sheep to follow him away from the farm. But the sheep were not as stupid as the wolf thought them to be. They got scared by the wolf and started bleating. Hearing their cries, the shepherd and his son came running to rescue them, and the wolf had to run away.

After a few days the wolf came up with another plan and silently attacked one sheep and ran 

away with it. He ate the meat and save the sheep’s skin. He used it as a disguise to look like a sheep. The next day, he went to the farm and lured the sheep away from the farm and he succeeded. The sheep thought it was another sheep whom they all were following. They started following the wolf and went far away from the farm. They were so far that the shepherd could not hear them.

It was a day of celebration for the shepherds and the shepherd’s son wanted a mutton broth that day. He went out and picked the first big sheep he could find and killed it for the supper. The big sheep was none other than the wolf disguised as a sheep and this is how all the sheep got saved from the wolf.
