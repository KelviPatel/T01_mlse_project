The Cows and the Tiger
Once upon a time, there lived a cow on a small farm. She used to go grazing in the forest with her three other friends. They were good friends and did everything together. They grazed together and stayed together because of which no tigers or lions were able to kill them for food.

One day they went grazing and they fought amongst themselves and decided to graze in four different directions. A tiger was lurking in the tall grass when all four were fighting, he saw everything and decided to take advantage of the situation. As the cows started to move in different directions, the tiger waited until the four of them were apart from each other. And when they were far enough, the tiger killed them all one by one. Nobody would have posed a harm to these cows, had they been together.
