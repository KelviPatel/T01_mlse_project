There once lived a young shepherd boy who took his flock of sheep to the mountains for grazing every single day. One day he became bored and thought it would be funny to play a trick on the villagers. He cried out, “Wolf! Wolf! A wolf is attacking the sheep!” The boy cried so loud that the villagers got worried. They immediately ran towards the mountains to help him.

When they reached there, there was no wolf, just the boy laughing at them. The boy repeated this trick several times, each time fooling the villagers. But one day, a real wolf appeared. The boy got scared and started crying for help in fear.

“Wolf! Wolf! Please help!” But this time, none of the villagers came. The villagers thought that this might be one of the boy’s trick to fool them and none of them went to help him.sed the sheep, and the boy learned a hard lesson.
