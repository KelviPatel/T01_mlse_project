10. The Ugly Duckling
Once upon a time, there lived a family of ducks on a farm. In the family nest, there were five little eggs and one big egg. One day, the five little eggs started to crack and five pretty yellow baby ducklings came out.

Then the big egg started to crack, and one big ugly duckling came out. “That’s strange!” thought the Mummy duck. 

None of the siblings played with him. “Go away,” they said. “You are ugly!”

Ugly duckling was sad, so he went to find some new friends.

“Go away!” said the sheep.

“Go away!” said the horse.

“Go away!” said the goose.

“Go away!” said the pig

No one wanted to be his friend. So the ugly duckling decided to leave the farm, he found an empty barn and started living there. He was cold, sad and alone.

And when it was spring, the ugly duckling left the barn and went back to the point. He was very thirsty and put his beak into the water. He saw a beautiful white bird. “Wow!” he said. “Who’s is that?”

“It’s you,” said another beautiful white bird.

“Me?” But I am an ugly duckling.

“Not anymore, you are a beautiful swan like me. Do you want to be my friend?”

“Yes.” The duckling was overjoyed.

And the two swans flew away as the other animals watched.
