The Young Crab and His Mother 
One day, a young  crab and his mother were strolling along the sea shore. When they were walking, the mother crab noticed that her son was walking sideways, instead of straight.

“Son, why do you walk like that?” she asked. “You should walk forward, not sideways. It is much more graceful and proper.”

“But mother, how can I walk forward?” the young crab replied. “This is how you taught me to walk. This is how all of us walk.”

The mother crab realized that she had been walking sideways all her life, and never noticed it. She decided to try to walk forward, to set a good example for her son. But as soon as she lifted one claw and moved it forward, she lost her balance and fell. She kept trying again and again, but failed each time.

The young crab stood by his mother’s side and watched his mother’s attempts with amusement.

“Mother, you see that it is impossible for us to walk forward,” he said. “We are crabs, and this is how we are made. We should be proud of our sideways walk, and not try to imitate others who are different from us.”

The mother crab sighed and gave up. She realized that her son was right and they continued their walk along the shore, side by side, happy and content.
