The Elephant and Friends
Once upon a time, there was an elephant, who wandered in a big forest. He was all alone and wanted to make friends. One day, when he was roaming around he met a monkey. “Will you be my friend,” he asked the monkey.

“You are too big to jump from tree to tree, branch to branch and have fun with us. So I can’t be your friend,” said the monkey.

The elephant than came across a rabbit and asked him to be his friend. The rabbit replied, “You are too big to fit in my small home. You cannot be my friend,” said the rabbit.

The elephant than met a frog and asked him the same question. “You are so big and heavy; you won’t be able to jump like me. So you can’t be my friend. The elephant felt bad and started walking and then he met a fox.

He asked the fox, “Will you be my friend?” The fox replied that, “You are too big to be my friend.” Disappointed the elephant walked back home with no friends. 

The next day he woke up hearing loud screams. He got out of his bed and opened the front door only to see all the animals running here and there in fear. The elephant stopped a monkey and asked what was happening and he came to know that a tiger was attacking all the animals of the jungle, and they were running to save their lives.

The elephant wanted to help the small animals and decided to go to the tiger.

“Please sir, don’t kill my friends. Leave them alone,” the elephant urged.

The tiger laughed and asked him to mind his own business.

There was no way the tiger could be stopped so the elephant kicked the tiger and scared him away.

When all the animals of the forest learned how the elephant saved their lives, the animals agreed to be friends with him.
